1
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>As the first century</i>
<i>of the Targaryen dynasty</i>

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,599
<i>came to a close,</i>

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,810
<i>the health of the Old King,</i>

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>Jaehaerys, was failing.</i>

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>In those days, House Targaryen</i>

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>stood at the height of its strength</i>

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,322
<i>with 10 adult dragons under its yoke.</i>

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,784
<i>No power in the world</i>
<i>could stand against it.</i>

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,621
<i>King Jaehaerys reigned</i>
<i>over nearly 60 years</i>

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>of peace and prosperity.</i>

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,877
<i>But tragedy had claimed both his sons,</i>

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,087
<i>leaving his succession in doubt.</i>

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,340
<i>So, in the year 101,</i>

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,843
<i>the Old King called a Great Council</i>

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,470
<i>to choose an heir.</i>

16
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,974
<i>Over a thousand lords made</i>
<i>the journey to Harrenhal.</i>

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>Fourteen succession claims were heard</i>

18
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,607
<i>but only two were truly considered:</i>

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,</i>
<i>the King's eldest descendant,</i>

20
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>and her younger cousin,</i>
<i>Prince Viserys Targaryen,</i>

21
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,118
<i>the King's eldest male descendant.</i>

22
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:28,254
It is declared by all lords paramount

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,883
and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms,

24
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:36,304
that Prince Viserys Targaryen

25
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,891
be made Prince of Dragonstone.

26
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>Rhaenys, a woman,</i>

27
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,188
<i>would not inherit the Iron Throne.</i>

28
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,151
<i>The lords instead chose Viserys,</i>

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,904
<i>my father.</i>

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,493
<i>Jaehaerys called the Great Council</i>

31
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,288
<i>to prevent a war being</i>
<i>fought over his succession.</i>

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>For he knew the cold truth.</i>

33
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,751
<i>The only thing that could tear down</i>

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>the House of the Dragon,</i>

35
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,713
<i>was itself.</i>

36
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>Dohaerﾄ《, </i>Syrax!

37
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,791
<i>Umbﾄ《.</i>

38
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>Rybﾄ《!</i>

39
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,265
Welcome back, Princess.

40
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,892
I trust your ride was pleasant.

41
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,061
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

42
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,270
I am relieved.

43
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,649
Every time that golden beast
brings you back unspoiled,

44
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,651
it saves my head from a spike.

45
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
Syrax is growing quickly.

46
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,739
She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,700
That's almost large enough to saddle two.

48
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,495
I believe I'm quite content
as a spectator, thank you.

49
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>Dohaerﾄ《.</i>

50
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
<i>Naejot!</i>

51
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,508
Rhaenyra.

52
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,097
You know I don't like you to go flying
while I'm in this condition.

53
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,557
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

54
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,562
-Your Grace.
-Good morrow, Alicent.

55
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,939
Did you sleep?

56
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,982
-I slept.
-How long?

57
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,277
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

58
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,613
Well, here you are,
surrounded by attendants,

59
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,448
all focused on the babe.

60
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,867
Someone has to attend to you.

61
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,748
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

62
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,335
This discomfort is how we serve the realm.

63
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,630
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

64
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,885
We have royal wombs, you and I.

65
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,722
The childbed is our battlefield.

66
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,727
We must learn to face it with a stiff lip.

67
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,022
Now take a bath.

68
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,024
You stink of dragon.

69
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,363
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe you
might be looking up the wrong end."

70
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,994
My lords.

71
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,996
The growing alliance among the Free Cities

72
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,166
has taken to styling
itself "the Triarchy."

73
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,251
They have massed on Bloodstone

74
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,671
and are presently ridding the Stepstones
of its pirate infestation.

75
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,299
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

76
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,467
A man called Craghas Drahar

77
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,721
has styled himself the prince-admiral
of this Triarchy.

78
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,099
They call him "The Crabfeeder"

79
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,102
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

80
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,397
And are we meant to weep
for dead pirates?

81
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,566
-No, Your Grace.
-Rhaenyra, you're late.

82
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,693
King's cupbearer must not be late.

83
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,696
-Leaves people wanting for cups.
-I was visiting Mother.

84
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,241
On dragonback?

85
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,494
Hey, Your Grace,
at Prince Daemon's urging,

86
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,122
the crown has invested significant capital

87
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,626
in the re-training and re-equipping
of his City Watch.

88
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,005
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

89
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:31,010
and provide an assessment of his progress
as commander of the Watch.

90
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,638
Do you think Daemon
is distracted by his present tasks?

91
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,681
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

92
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,018
Well, one would hope so, considering
the associated costs.

93
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,438
Then let us all consider
your gold well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

94
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,566
I would urge that you not allow
this Triarchy much latitude

95
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,818
in the Stepstones, Your Grace.

96
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,988
If those shipping lanes should fall,
it will beggar our ports.

97
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,699
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys,

98
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,410
and takes it under advisement.

99
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,086
Shall we discuss the Heir's Tournament,
Your Grace?

100
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,672
I would be delighted.

101
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,757
Will the maesters' name day
prediction hold, Mellos?

102
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,344
You must understand that these things
are mere estimations, my King,

103
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,555
but we have all been
poring over the moon charts,

104
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,685
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

105
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,562
The cost of the tournament
is not negligible.

106
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,358
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

107
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,360
Most of the lords and knights

108
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,280
are certainly on their way to King's
Landing already. To turn them back now--

109
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,282
The tourney will take
the better part of a week.

110
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,159
Before the games are over,
my son will be born,

111
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,869
and the whole realm will celebrate.

112
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,998
We have no way of predicting
the sex of the child.

113
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,875
Of course, no maester's capable
of rendering an opinion

114
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,460
free of conditions, are they now?

115
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,505
There's a boy in the Queen's belly.

116
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,340
I know it.

117
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,136
And my heir will soon
put all of this damnable

118
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,138
hand-wringing to rest himself.

119
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,727
He passed through the Red Keep's gates
at first light.

120
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,520
Does my father know he's here?

121
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,938
-No.
-Good.

122
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,615
Gods be good.

123
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,783
It's all right, ser.

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,639
Aye.

125
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,797
I bought you something.

126
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,637
Do you know what it is?

127
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,515
It's Valyrian steel.

128
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,309
Like Dark Sister.

129
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
Turn around.

130
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,122
Now,

131
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,918
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

132
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,263
Did you read it?

133
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,098
Of course, I read it.

134
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,475
When Princess Nymeria
arrived in Dorne,

135
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
who did she take to husband?

136
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,854
A man.

137
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,439
What was his name?

138
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,274
Lord Something.

139
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,900
If you answer with
"Lord Something,"

140
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,735
Septa Marlow will be furious.

141
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,737
She's funny when she's furious.

142
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,493
You're always like this
when you're worried.

143
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,995
Like what?

144
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,413
Disagreeable.

145
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,836
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

146
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,337
with a son.

147
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,173
I only worry for my mother.

148
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,634
I hope for my father that he gets a son.

149
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,971
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

150
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,974
You want him to have a son?

151
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,934
I want to fly with you on dragonback,

152
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,021
see the great wonders
across the Narrow Sea, and eat only cake.

153
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,648
-I'm being serious.
-I never jest about cake.

154
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,859
You aren't worried about your position?

155
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,487
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

156
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,952
-Where are you going?
-Home. The hour has grown late.

157
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,955
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar

158
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,124
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

159
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,210
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

160
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,379
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

161
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,298
and burned her own fleet off Sunspear

162
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,383
to show her people that
they were finished running.

163
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,013
-What are you doing?
-So you remember.

164
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,975
-If the Septa sees this book, then--
-Fuck the Septa.

165
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,477
Rhaenyra!

166
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,699
Is it healing?

167
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,619
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

168
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,915
Can you say yet what it is?

169
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,167
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

170
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,378
They are searching
the texts for similar cases.

171
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,922
It's a small cut from sitting the throne.

172
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,881
It's nothing.

173
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,511
The King has been under heavy stresses
preparing for the birth.

174
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,183
Bad humors of the mind
can adversely affect the body.

175
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,395
Whatever it is, it needs to be kept quiet.

176
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,441
We should leech it again, maester.

177
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,069
It's a wound that refuses to heal,
Grand Maester.

178
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,281
Might I suggest cauterization?

179
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,951
Cauterization would be a wise
course of treatment, Your Grace.

180
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,579
-It will be painful.
-Fine.

181
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,081
Fine.

182
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,513
You spend more time in that bath
than I do on the throne.

183
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
This is the only place

184
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,976
I can find comfort these days.

185
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,396
It's tepid.

186
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
It's as warm as the maesters will allow.

187
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,402
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

188
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,197
After this miserable pregnancy,

189
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,950
I wouldn't be surprised if
I hatched an actual dragon.

190
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,120
Then he will be loved and cherished.

191
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,124
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

192
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,626
Really?

193
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,629
-She even named her.
-Dare I ask?

194
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,256
Visenya.

195
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,843
She chose a dragon's egg for the cradle
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

196
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,345
Gods be good.

197
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,972
This family already has its Visenya.

198
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,602
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

199
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,521
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

200
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,192
I'm sure he will reemerge for the tourney.

201
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,778
He could never stay away from the lists.

202
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,196
The tourney

203
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,616
to celebrate the firstborn son
that we presently do not have.

204
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,371
You do understand nothing
will cause the babe to grow a cock

205
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,247
if it does not already possess one?

206
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,542
This child is a boy, Aemma.

207
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,127
I'm certain of it.

208
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,464
I've never been more certain of anything.

209
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
The dream.

210
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,222
It was clearer than a memory.

211
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,018
Our son was born wearing
Aegon's iron crown.

212
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,607
When I heard the sound
of thundering hooves,

213
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,902
splintering shields, and ringing swords,

214
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,905
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne

215
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,659
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled

216
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,994
and all the dragons roared as one.

217
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,999
Born wearing a crown?

218
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,377
Gods spare me,

219
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,796
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

220
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,392
This is the last time, Viserys.

221
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,105
I've lost one babe in the cradle,

222
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,107
had two stillbirths, and two pregnancies

223
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,317
ended well before their term.

224
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,781
That's five in twice as many years.

225
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,369
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir,

226
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,998
and I'm sorry if I have
failed you in that. I am.

227
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,796
But I've mourned
all the dead children I can.

228
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,695
Commander on the floor!

229
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,079
When I took command of the Watch,
you were stray mongrels,

230
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,000
starving and undisciplined.

231
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,253
Now,

232
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,631
you're a pack of hounds.

233
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,175
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

234
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,890
My brother's city has fallen into squalor.

235
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,937
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

236
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,148
No longer.

237
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,275
Beginning tonight,
King's Landing will learn

238
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,110
to fear the color gold.

239
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,908
Get up!

240
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,929
Raper!

241
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,226
No! No! No! No! No!

242
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,736
Thief!

243
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,862
No!

244
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,077
Murderer!

245
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,056
<i>It was an unprecedented</i>
<i>roundup of criminals of every ilk.</i>

246
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,144
<i>Your brother made a public show of it,</i>
<i>meting out the summary judgments himself.</i>

247
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:34,274
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart
to haul away the resulting dismemberments

248
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,400
when it was done.

249
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,402
Gods be good.

250
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,280
The Prince cannot be allowed to act

251
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,116
with this kind of unchecked impunity.

252
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,287
-Brother.
-Daemon.

253
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,042
Carry on. You were saying
something about my impunity.

254
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,048
You are to explain your doings
with the City Watch.

255
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,595
Your new "gold cloaks" made quite
the impression last night, didn't they?

256
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,930
Did they?

257
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,266
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

258
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,352
They're an extension of the crown.

259
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,396
The Watch was enforcing the crown's laws.

260
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,147
Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

261
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,858
My Prince, I don't think--

262
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,486
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

263
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,363
is hardly in line with our laws.

264
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,031
Nobles from every corner of the realm

265
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,033
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

266
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,660
for my brother's tourney.

267
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,288
Do you want them mugged, raped, murdered?

268
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,207
You mightn't know this unless
you left the safety of the Red Keep,

269
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,668
but much of King's Landing
is seen by the smallfolk

270
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,379
as lawless and terrifying.

271
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,009
Our city should be safe
for all its people.

272
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,844
I agree.

273
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,640
I just hope you don't have to maim
half of my city to achieve this.

274
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,142
Time will tell.

275
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,898
We installed Prince Daemon
as commander to promote law and order.

276
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,359
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

277
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,111
Thank you for your support, Lord Corlys.

278
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,988
If only the Prince would
show the same devotion

279
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,949
to his lady wife as he does his work,
Your Grace.

280
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,703
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

281
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,997
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

282
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,707
Lady Rhea is your wife,

283
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,126
a good and honorable lady of the Vale.

284
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,129
In the Vale, men are said to fuck sheep
instead of women.

285
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,673
I can assure you, the sheep are prettier.

286
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,758
Dear me.

287
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,510
You made a vow before the Seven
to honor your wife in marriage.

288
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,472
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea to you,
Lord Hightower,

289
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,183
if you're in want
of a woman to warm your bed.

290
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,186
Your own lady wife passed recently.

291
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,773
Did she not?

292
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,774
Otto.

293
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,613
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

294
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,033
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

295
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,410
Must you indulge him?

296
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,375
My apologies, Your Grace.

297
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,669
This council has, at great expense,

298
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,631
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

299
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,675
Enforce my laws, but understand,

300
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,387
any further performances like last night's
will be answered.

301
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,227
Understood, Your Grace.

302
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,118
King's Landing has been in decline since
my grandmother passed.

303
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,120
In the end,

304
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,833
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

305
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,214
What troubles you, my Prince?

306
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,139
I could bring in another.

307
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,224
Perhaps a maiden.

308
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,768
I have several.

309
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,773
I could even arrange one with silver hair.

310
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,657
You are Daemon Targaryen.

311
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,869
Rider of Caraxes. Wielder of Dark Sister.

312
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,164
The King cannot replace you.

313
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,303
Be welcome!

314
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,806
I know many of you have
traveled long leagues

315
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,059
to be at these games.

316
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,270
But I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

317
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,816
When I look at
the fine knights in these lists,

318
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,445
I see a group without equal
in our histories.

319
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:36,993
And this great day
has been made more auspicious

320
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,664
by the news
that I am happy to share:

321
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,834
Queen Aemma has begun her labors!

322
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,300
May the luck of the Seven
shine upon all combatants!

323
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,668
A mystery knight?

324
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,878
No, a Cole, of the Stormlands.

325
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,297
I've never heard of House Cole.

326
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,216
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

327
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,343
I would humbly ask for the favor

328
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,262
of "The Queen Who Never Was."

329
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,353
Good fortune to you, cousin.

330
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,814
I would gladly take it
if I thought I needed it.

331
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,407
You could have
Baratheon's tongue for that.

332
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,576
Tongues will not change the succession.

333
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,286
Let them wag.

334
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,212
Lord Stokeworth's daughter
is promised to that young Tarly squire.

335
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,839
Lord Massey's son?

336
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,633
They're to be married
as soon as he wins his knighthood.

337
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,760
Best get on with it.

338
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,806
I heard that Lady Elinor is hiding
a swollen belly beneath her dress.

339
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,123
What do you know about
this Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

340
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm told Ser Criston is common-born,
son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

341
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,755
But other than that,
and the fact that he's just unhorsed

342
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,799
both of the Baratheon lads,

343
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,592
I really couldn't say.

344
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,489
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen,

345
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,990
Prince of the City,

346
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,828
will now choose his first opponent!

347
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,659
For his first challenge,

348
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,745
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

349
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,331
Ser Gwayne Hightower of Oldtown,

350
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,126
eldest son of the Hand of the King.

351
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,433
Five dragons on Daemon.

352
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,342
-Nicely done, Uncle.
-Thank you, Princess.

353
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,347
Now, I'm fairly certain
I can win these games, Lady Alicent.

354
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,767
Having your favor would all but assure it.

355
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,491
Good luck, my Prince.

356
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,272
-What's happening?
-The infant is in breech, Your Grace.

357
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,858
All attempts to turn the babe have failed.

358
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,987
-Do something for her!
-We've given her as much

359
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,990
milk of the poppy as we can
without risking the child.

360
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,575
Your Queen is a strong woman.

361
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,953
She's fighting with all her might,
but it may not be enough.

362
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,830
No!

363
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,040
Aemma.

364
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,627
Aemma, I'm here.

365
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,961
I'm here.

366
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,048
I'm here. It's all right.

367
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,091
-It's all right.
-I don't wanna do this.

368
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,885
You're going to be all right.

369
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,012
You're going to be all right.

370
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,246
Kill him!

371
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,791
And the day grows ugly.

372
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,548
I wonder if this is how we should
celebrate the birth of our future king.

373
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,759
With wanton violence.

374
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,220
It's been 70 years
since King Maegor's end.

375
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,138
These knights are as green
as summer grass.

376
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,848
None have known real war.

377
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,685
Their lords sent them to the tourney field

378
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,562
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed,

379
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
and we expect them to act
with honor and grace.

380
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,235
It's a marvel that war
didn't break out at first blood.

381
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,092
Mellos.

382
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,302
Your Grace.

383
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,055
If you would.

384
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,650
During a difficult birth,

385
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:52,071
it sometimes becomes necessary
for the father

386
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,949
to make an impossible choice.

387
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,077
Well, speak it.

388
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,415
To sacrifice one or to lose them both.

389
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,003
There is a chance that
we can save the child.

390
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,088
A technique is taught at the Citadel,

391
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,090
which involves cutting
directly into the womb

392
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,176
to free the infant.

393
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,928
-But the resulting blood loss--
-Seven Hells, Mellos.

394
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,610
You can save the child?

395
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,572
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

396
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,420
Ser Criston Cole will now tilt against

397
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,424
Ser Daemon Targaryen, Prince of the City!

398
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,873
-Viserys.
-Yes?

399
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,002
They're going to bring the babe out now.

400
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,985
I love you.

401
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,495
-What is happening?
-No, it's all right.

402
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,415
No, what is happening?

403
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,959
-Viserys, what--
-No, it's all right.

404
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,836
-What are you doing?
-They're going to bring the babe out.

405
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,004
How are they--

406
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,714
-It's all right.
-Viserys, please.

407
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,966
-It's all right.
-No, I'm scared.

408
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,593
-Don't be scared.
-What is happening?

409
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,261
Don't be scared.
They're going to bring the babe out.

410
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,680
-Oh no.
-It's all right.

411
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,682
They're going to bring the babe out.

412
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,937
No! No! No!

413
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,066
-I'm making the first incision.
- No, no, no!

414
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,569
Viserys, no! Please!

415
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,947
-No, no, no!
-Don't be scared.

416
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,430
Sword!

417
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,974
Prince Daemon Targaryen

418
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,435
wishes to continue in a contest of arms!

419
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,089
Yield.

420
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,549
Yield.

421
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,377
Gods. He's Dornish.

422
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,630
I was hoping to ask
for the Princess's favor.

423
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,186
I wish you luck, Ser Criston.

424
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,604
Princess.

425
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,285
Congratulations, Your Grace.

426
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,370
You have a son.

427
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,834
It's a boy?

428
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,253
A new heir, Your Grace.

429
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,553
<i>Had you and the Queen chosen a name?</i>

430
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,224
Baelon.

431
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,137
They're waiting for you.

432
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,236
<i>Dracarys.</i>

433
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,152
-Where's Rhaenyra?
-Your Grace.

434
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,072
This is the last thing
any of us wish to discuss

435
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,198
at this dark hour,

436
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,492
but I consider the matter urgent.

437
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,493
What matter?

438
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,454
That of your succession.

439
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,708
These recent tragedies
have left you without an obvious heir.

440
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,627
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

441
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,129
Despite how difficult
this time is, Your Grace,

442
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,341
I feel it important
the succession be firmly in place

443
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,884
for the stability of the realm.

444
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,136
The succession is already set

445
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,721
by precedent and by law.

446
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,348
Shall we say his name?

447
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,519
Daemon Targaryen.

448
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,522
If Daemon were to remain
the uncontested heir,

449
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,108
it could destabilize the realm.

450
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,110
The realm? Or this council?

451
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,987
No one here can know what Daemon would do
were he king,

452
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,698
but no one can doubt his ambition.

453
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,451
Look at what he did
with the "gold cloaks."

454
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,578
The City Watch is fiercely loyal to him.

455
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,457
-An army 2,000 strong.
-An army you gave him, Otto.

456
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,503
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

457
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,047
As Master of Coin,
you said he was a spendthrift

458
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,632
that would beggar the realm.

459
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,926
Putting Daemon in command
of the City Watch

460
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,469
was your solution!

461
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,555
A half-measure, Your Grace.

462
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,641
The truth is, Daemon should be
far away from this court.

463
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,852
Daemon is my brother.

464
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,061
My blood.

465
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,064
And he will have his place at my court.

466
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,150
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace,

467
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,404
but if the gods should visit
some further tragedy on you,

468
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,657
-either by design or by accident.
-"Design"?

469
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,617
What are you saying?

470
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,995
My brother would murder me, take my crown?

471
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,664
Are you?

472
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,542
Please.

473
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,464
Daemon has ambition, yes,
but not for the throne.

474
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,257
He lacks the patience for it.

475
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,050
The gods have yet to make a man who

476
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,471
lacks the patience for absolute power,
Your Grace.

477
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:09,558
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

478
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,977
for the King to name a successor.

479
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,979
Well, who else would have a claim?

480
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,821
The King's firstborn child.

481
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,032
Rhaenyra? A girl?

482
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,744
No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.

483
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,954
That is only by tradition
and precedent, Lord Strong.

484
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,248
If order and stability
so concerns this council,

485
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,169
then perhaps we shouldn't break 100 years
of it by naming a girl heir.

486
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:41,006
Daemon would be a second Maegor, or worse.

487
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,717
He is impulsive and violent.

488
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,677
It is the duty of this council

489
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,056
to protect the King
and the realm from him.

490
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,518
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
but that is the truth as I see it,

491
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,144
and I know that others here agree.

492
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:58,190
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

493
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,108
You wouldn't have to,
Your Grace.

494
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,236
There are others who would have a claim.

495
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,279
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

496
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,657
-"The Queen Who Never Was"?
-Rhaenys was the only child

497
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,908
of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

498
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,993
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council,

499
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,079
and she already has a male heir.

500
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,540
Just moments ago,
you announced your support for Daemon!

501
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,333
If we cannot agree on an heir,
then how can we expect--

502
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,835
My wife and son are dead!

503
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:25,217
I will not sit here and suffer crows
that come to feast on their corpses!

504
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,045
Send a raven to Oldtown. Straight away.

505
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:05,799
My Lady.

506
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,978
My darling.

507
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,780
How's Rhaenyra?

508
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,993
She lost her mother.

509
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,205
The Queen was well-loved by all.

510
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,502
I found myself thinking
of your own mother today.

511
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,720
-How is His Grace?
-Very low.

512
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,098
Which is why I sent for you.

513
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,980
I thought you might go to him,

514
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,733
offer him comfort.

515
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,445
In his chambers?

516
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,120
I wouldn't know what to say.

517
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,830
Stop that.

518
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,834
He'll be glad of a visitor.

519
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,637
You might wear one of
your mother's dresses.

520
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,801
The Lady Alicent Hightower, Your Grace.

521
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,559
What is it, Alicent?

522
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,186
I thought I might come
and look in on you, Your Grace.

523
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
I brought a book.

524
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,485
That's very kind, thank you.

525
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,951
It's a favorite of mine.

526
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,579
I do know how passionate
you are for the histories.

527
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,874
Yes, I am.

528
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,601
When my mother died,

529
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,189
people only ever spoke to me in riddles.

530
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,942
All I wanted was for someone
to say that they were sorry

531
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,569
for what happened to me.

532
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,700
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

533
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,499
Thank you.

534
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,087
The King's sole heir once again.

535
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,716
Might we drink to our future?

536
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,011
Quiet!

537
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,639
Your Prince will speak!

538
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,686
Silence!

539
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,610
<i>Before we begin, Your Grace,</i>

540
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:40,031
I have a report I feel compelled to share.

541
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,034
Last night,

542
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,621
Prince Daemon bought out
one of the pleasure houses

543
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,248
on the Street of Silk,

544
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,586
to entertain officers of the City Watch

545
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,212
and other friends of his.

546
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,176
King and Council have
long rued my position

547
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,304
as next in line for the throne.

548
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,266
But dream and pray as they all might,

549
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,269
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

550
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,232
The gods give just as the gods take away.

551
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,276
<i>He toasted Prince Baelon.</i>

552
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,485
To the King's son.

553
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,488
Styling him

554
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,825
"The Heir for a Day."

555
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,669
<i>I corroborated this report</i>
<i>with three separate witnesses.</i>

556
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,882
<i>The evening was, by all</i>
<i>accounts, a celebration.</i>

557
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,054
You cut the image
of the conqueror, brother.

558
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,848
Did you say it?

559
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,685
I don't know what you mean.

560
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,228
You will address me as "Your Grace,"

561
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,398
or I will have my Kingsguard
cut out your tongue.

562
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:03,281
"The Heir for a Day." Did you say it?

563
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,794
We must all mourn
in our own way, Your Grace.

564
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,632
My family has just been destroyed.

565
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,719
But instead of being
by my side, or Rhaenyra's,

566
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,639
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

567
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,850
Laughing with your whores
and your lickspittles!

568
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,231
You have no allies at court but me!

569
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,775
I have only ever defended you!

570
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,444
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

571
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,446
You've only ever tried to send me away.

572
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,241
To the Vale, to the City Watch,

573
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,284
anywhere but by your side.

574
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,328
Ten years you've been king,

575
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,415
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

576
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,710
-Why would I do that?
-Because I'm your brother.

577
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,796
And the blood of the dragon runs thick.

578
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,881
Then why do you cut me so deeply?

579
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,133
I've only ever spoken the truth.

580
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,969
I see Otto Hightower for what he is.

581
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,014
-An unwavering and loyal Hand?
-A cunt.

582
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,058
A second son who stands to inherit nothing

583
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,560
he doesn't seize for himself.

584
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,729
Otto Hightower is a more honorable man

585
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,939
-than you could ever be.
-He doesn't protect you.

586
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,983
-I would.
-From what?

587
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,192
Yourself.

588
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,699
You're weak, Viserys.

589
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,786
And that council of leeches knows it.

590
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,788
They all prey on you for their own ends.

591
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,879
I have decided to name a new heir.

592
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,506
-I'm your heir.
-Not anymore.

593
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,636
You are to return to Runestone
and your lady wife at once,

594
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,806
and you are to do so without quarrel

595
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,850
by order of your King.

596
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,158
Your Grace.

597
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,885
Father.

598
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:19,769
Balerion was the last living creature
to have seen Old Valyria before the Doom.

599
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,482
Its greatness and its flaws.

600
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,610
When you look at the dragons,
what do you see?

601
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,736
What?

602
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,655
You haven't spoken a word to me since

603
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,157
mother's funeral,

604
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,201
-and now you send your Kingsguard down.
-Answer me.

605
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,872
It's important.

606
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,957
What do you see?

607
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,426
-I suppose I see us.
-Tell me.

608
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,472
Everyone says Targaryens
are closer to gods than to men,

609
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,100
but they say that because of our dragons.

610
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,271
Without them,
we're just like everyone else.

611
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,903
The idea that we control the dragons

612
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,529
is an illusion.

613
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,242
They're a power man should
never have trifled with.

614
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,163
One that brought Valyria its doom.

615
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,750
If we don't mind our own histories,
it will do the same to us.

616
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,920
Targaryen must understand
this to be King

617
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,505
or Queen.

618
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,345
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

619
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,349
I have wasted the years
since you were born

620
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,142
wanting for a son.

621
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,073
<i>You are the very best of your mother.</i>

622
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,411
And I believe it, I know she did,

623
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,830
that you could be a great ruling queen.

624
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,582
Daemon is your heir.

625
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,920
<i>Daemon was not made</i>
<i>to wear the crown.</i>

626
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,005
But I believe that you were.

627
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,884
<i>Corlys of House Velaryon,</i>

628
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:19,264
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark.

629
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,766
I, Corlys Velaryon,

630
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:25,728
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark,

631
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,897
<i>promise to be faithful to King Viserys</i>

632
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,817
<i>and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.</i>

633
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,069
<i>I pledge fealty to them</i>

634
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,154
<i>and shall defend them against all enemies</i>

635
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,782
<i>in good faith and without deceit.</i>

636
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:45,123
I swear this by the old gods and the new.

637
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,044
<i>This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.</i>

638
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,797
A dragon's saddle is one thing,

639
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,009
but the Iron Throne is the most
dangerous seat in the realm.

640
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,886
I, Lord Hobert Hightower,

641
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,306
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel,

642
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,849
and Voice of Oldtown,

643
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,643
promise to be faithful to King Viserys

644
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,938
and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.

645
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,276
<i>I pledge fealty to them</i>

646
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,278
<i>and shall defend them against all enemies</i>

647
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,281
<i>in good faith and without deceit.</i>

648
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,826
<i>I swear this by the old gods and the new.</i>

649
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,209
Give me your hand.

650
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,726
I, Boremund Baratheon,

651
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,064
promise to be faithful to King Viserys.

652
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,944
<i>There's something else</i>
<i>that I need to tell you.</i>

653
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,197
<i>It might be difficult</i>
<i>for you to understand,</i>

654
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,074
<i>but you must hear it.</i>

655
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,284
Our histories,

656
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,577
they tell us that Aegon looked across

657
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,496
the Blackwater from Dragonstone,

658
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,123
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

659
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,461
But ambition alone is not
what drove him to conquest.

660
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,713
It was a dream.

661
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,883
And just as Daenys foresaw
the end of Valyria,

662
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:22,220
Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men.

663
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,306
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter

664
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,642
gusting out of the distant north.

665
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,602
I, Rickon Stark,

666
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:30,937
Lord of Winterfell--

667
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,440
<i>Aegon saw absolute darkness</i>
<i>riding on those winds.</i>

668
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,694
<i>And whatever dwells within</i>
<i>will destroy the world of the living.</i>

669
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,738
<i>When this Great Winter comes, Rhaenyra,</i>

670
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,700
all of Westeros must stand against it.

671
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,244
And if the world of men is to survive,

672
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:49,288
a Targaryen must be seated
on the Iron Throne.

673
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,417
<i>A king or queen,</i>
<i>strong enough to unite the realm</i>

674
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,044
<i>against the cold and the dark.</i>

675
01:01:57,338 --> 01:02:00,091
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

676
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,220
This secret,

677
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,224
it's been passed from king to heir
since Aegon's time.

678
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,603
Now you must promise to carry it

679
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,729
and protect it.

680
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,193
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

681
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,449
Promise me.

682
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:35,751
I, Viserys Targaryen, first of his name,

683
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,839
<i>King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,</i>

684
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,091
<i>and the First Men,</i>

685
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,427
<i>Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,</i>

686
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,221
<i>and Protector of the Realm,</i>

687
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,806
<i>do hereby name</i>

688
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,601
Rhaenyra Targaryen,

689
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,936
Princess of Dragonstone

690
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,230
and heir to the Iron Throne.
